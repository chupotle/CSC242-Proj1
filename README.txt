Alright, so there's three folders in this directory. For all of the project folders, just compile all of the .java files. I included them pre-compiled for convenience. to run it, just run "Driver.class". The same applies for all three of the project folders. basicTTT corresponds to part 1 of the project and 9BoardTTT corresponds to part 2. TournamentTTT just has modifications so it would work with the tournament program. It isn't relevant to the Project 1.

If the TournamentTTT doesnt function with the SuperTTT program, just ignore it.
